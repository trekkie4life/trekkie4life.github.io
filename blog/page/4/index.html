  <div class="entry-content"><p>8:30am &ndash; Arrive</p>

<p>Quick check-in to refresh our brains and make sure everyone is up to speed and to plan our attack for the morning and day.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.minus.com/imADChWNwphdy.jpg" alt="White board session" /></p>

<p>No one pushed to master, we made new branches based on the feature, when we had a feature working, we pushed to GitHub and then submitted a Pull Request. Someone else on the team would review it then merge it. We had a really good workflow going.</p>

<p>So, our project? Make a &ldquo;cool faker&rdquo; gem to generate fake data for testing &ndash; eerily similar to &ldquo;Faker&rdquo; but instead of random names, we will use famous movie and tv show characters to populate the data.  What are we calling it? <strong>Cool Faker</strong> what else?!</p>

<p>Other than using Faker, we didn&rsquo;t know how it got or made the data, so we dove into the source code.  It was cool to see how much of it we could follow. Also, we saw that the Faker gem is self contained, all you have to do is download it because the gem comes bundled with all the people/company/etc data it uses.</p>

<p>We followed their example and then had to find a way to gather all the movie/tv characters we wanted without manually typing them in&hellip; because we are programming after all, let&rsquo;s use our brains and make the computer do it.</p>

<h2>API use to gather data</h2>

<p>We looked at using IMDB&rsquo;s API (Application Programming Interface), but the data you get from it is not clean at all, and since we were on a schedule, our first job was to look for clean data.  Luckily TheMovieDatabase (TMDB) had exactly what we needed and someone even made a Ruby gem that used their API.</p>

<p>After playing around with it, we got the a massive amount of data per movie, but the data was very well organized. Unfortunately there was no way using their API to return <em>just</em> character names. The information we got inluded everything, literally everything about the requested movie.  We tried several methods to parse the character names from the data object the API returned, and then wisely decided to just check what kind of object that data was, turns out it&rsquo;s a <code>PatchedOpenStruct</code> (a data structure similar to a Hash), from there some quick Googling and we learned a little bit about it and how to remove the nugget of character name data we wanted.  Easier than it sounds because the data was clean/well organized, but still an enjoyable little problem that makes you feel good when playing with an API for the first time.</p>

<p>On the other side, Jamie and I were getting our gem file structure down by breaking down Faker&rsquo;s and understanding how each file used another.</p>

<p>Quentin was did the vast majority of tests, I paired up with him for a bit on it to get my feet wet with RSpec. The syntax is great because it almost reads like normal english.</p>

<p>We decided in our whiteboarding and discussions that our MVP would be a gem that worked by plucking random character names. In order to test it, we used a tourny bracket (think, March Madness) application that used Cool Faker to populate the teams and then we modified the application to pick a random winner per matchup.  IT WORKED!!  High-fives went all around.</p>

<p>Our final version can throw up quotes from various sources and come up with team-names (or company names, whatever you [the user] desire).  For the names, you can even specify if you only want characters from a specific movie.</p>

<p>High fives and hugs to everyone on team Más Awesomos: Quentin Devauchelle, Jamie McKenzie, Nicholas Cu, and myself!</p>

<p>Presentations of Phase 2 one-day group projects from the Sea Lions, followed by Phase 1 two-day group projects from the Banana Slugs (that&rsquo;s us!), then some alums came in and showed their Phase 3 group projects. It was great fun and cool to see what we types of things we would be learning about and how some people implemented those technologies. I was impressed with everyone&rsquo;s stuff!</p>

<p>Post-presentations, it&rsquo;s group kareoke time at DBC to celebrate the ending of a phase. A couple people in each cohort are repeating the phase because they want to solidify their knowledge before moving on. It&rsquo;s what works best for them, it&rsquo;s never an easy decision, and it&rsquo;s definitely not failure by any means.  So it takes 12 weeks to become a junior developer, not 9. Is anyone seriously going to shake their head in shame at that? I don&rsquo;t think so. Good luck to all phases and cohorts moving forward!</p>

<p>10:15pm &ndash; Depart</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>7:55am &ndash; Arrive</p>

<p>Our instructors split us into teams, and I&rsquo;m paired with my brother from another mother, Quentin &ndash; and</p>

<p>Immediately we are out the door implementing the Agile methodology. We timebox, pitch ideas, hone them down, pick one.</p>

<ul>
<li>working agreement</li>
<li>division of labor</li>
<li>attack the problem</li>
</ul>


<p>12:30pm &ndash; Yoga and a super quick lunch</p>

<p>Phase 1 assessment &ndash; definitely was nervous, and I know they are basically taking a 5 second clip from a movie and trying to base their judgement on the entire movie from that clip&hellip; but they are clearly interested in the context, are you soaking in the big ideas and understanding them, can you communicate clearly, etc. Nervous and yet a good experience. DBC, you win again!</p>

<p>Even with 3 out of 4 team members having assessments today (as opposed to yesterday) and other appointments today, we were still able to finish bare-bones MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for group project!</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s our project? I&rsquo;ll describe it more in tomorrow&rsquo;s blog because I&rsquo;m a wee bit tired at the moment ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>8:15am &ndash; Arrive</strong></p>

<p>I was freakishly tired early last night, so slept in a bit this morning &ndash; it was exactly what I needed.</p>

<p><strong>Active Record</strong> &ndash; Active Record is essentialy a layer of Ruby code that runs between your database and your logic code.  When you want to make changes to the database, you write some Ruby, then migrate &ndash; the migrations make the actual changes what database you&rsquo;re using, then you only have to change a couple of lines of code. Now <em>that</em> is slick.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">db</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">migrate</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>The Database:</h2>

<p>Since Active Record interacts with the database, it&rsquo;s the M in MVC.</p>

<p>The syntax for ActiveRecord Migrations is as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CreateStudents</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Migration</span> <span class="c1"># each migration is a class</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:first_name</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:last_name</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:gender</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">date</span>   <span class="ss">:birthday</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">string</span> <span class="ss">:email</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may have noticed that there isn&rsquo;t an <code>id</code> column &ndash; that&rsquo;s because Active Record adds the unique primary key <code>id</code> to table <em>automatically</em>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s an even cooler thing that the migration class does? It is semi like git (version control), you can roll back and undo some changes.  How you might ask?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rake</span> <span class="ss">db</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">rollback</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>REMEMBER: migrations don&rsquo;t happen automagically when you create a new model, you have to <em>MANUALLY</em> run them.</p>

<p>When we create a <code>Student</code> model, a file is created in <code>app/models/student.rb</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Student</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Adding validations</h2>

<p>Why validate? Validations are hugely important in any web app, it&rsquo;s here that we check to ensure the data we want to put into the database is clean &amp; correct.</p>

<p><strong>Remember &ndash; validations created in our model class(es) don&rsquo;t actually change the database!</strong></p>

<p>The <code>validates</code> method sets up all our validations, first we pass which field(s) we want to validate, then we pass it a hash with the validation properties.  There are a ton of pre-made validation helpers or we can even make our own.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>7:40am &ndash; Arrive</strong></p>

<p>Get out of your comfort zone. It&rsquo;s important in a situation where you want to grow, learn and evolve as a human being, regardless of age. That holds true for programming as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hu32GdW.jpg" alt="Where the magic happens, it's true, give it a try" /></p>

<p><strong>The Law of Demeter</strong> &ndash; a set of coding rules (strong suggestion, emphasis on strong) that results in the creation of loosely coupled objects. A unit/object (class or method) should have only limited knowledge about other units, those others being only units &ldquo;closely&rdquo; related to the current unit/object.</p>

<p>Basically, try to make your classes single responsibility and your methods as well. That doesn&rsquo;t mean only one method to a class, but rather you want to be sure your class is highly cohesive&hellip; that everything in it is related to its central purpose.</p>

<h2>Object Relational Mapper (ORM)</h2>

<p>Build our own ORM that mimics some common features of ActiveRecord. Why not just learn to use RSpec right off the bat? Because we should understand that RSpec is just Ruby, written in a certain way to have its own dsl (domain specific language). RSpec is not magic, we <strong><em>CAN</em></strong> and <strong><em>SHOULD</em></strong> know what&rsquo;s going on under the hood when we take a peak. It&rsquo;s important as n00bs to develop proper habits now rather than having to unlearn bad ones and re-learn good ones.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;What excites you about programming?&rdquo;</h2>

<p>The ability to create and reach 39 (and growing) percent of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>

<p>Below the vertical axis is percentage of world&rsquo;s population, horizontal axis is years.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Internet_users_per_100_inhabitants_ITU.svg" alt="world internet usage graph" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to think about programming in this way:</p>

<h3>I have a need. I want to express it. How do I do it in this/that language?</h3>

<h2>Database Schema and PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>A self join is when a foreign key and the primary key it points to are in the same table.  In the pic below you&rsquo;ll notice we are showing that a user comment can be a reply to an earlier user comment.  We use a self join to make it a reality.  It&rsquo;s nice to find the beauty in simple things.</p>

<p><img src="http://i2.minus.com/iJUPUs3sj1qYx.jpg" alt="Always whiteboard your schema. Always. No exceptions." /></p>

<p>Rule one of databases &ndash; always illustrate your tables and how they relate to one another. Don&rsquo;t try juggling that stuff in your head. If it&rsquo;s a few tables, it might be ok. If it&rsquo;s hundreds of tables, not such a good idea. Build good habits now.</p>

<p>Soon it was time to implement some databases in PostgreSQL via Ruby.</p>

<p>Step 1 &ndash; remember to require postgres</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;pg&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Step 2 &ndash; don&rsquo;t be afraid of using a hash as an input parameter</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>
Step 3 &ndash; use binding variables to protect against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>. In SQLite it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;?&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;$1&rsquo; or &lsquo;$2&rsquo; (and so on). $1 refers to the element at index 0, $2 refers to the element at index 1 (etc, etc) of the array the variable is bound to.</p>

<p>The second mission for today is to learn more about testing so when we tackle ActiveRecord and RSpec we won&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s magic but that we&rsquo;ll understand what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>

<p>OOP (Object Oriented Programming)</p>

<p>Reading Practical Object Oriented Design for Ruby &ndash; affectionately referred to as &ldquo;POODR&rdquo; (pooh-der).</p>

<p>One problem we had was trying to keep the code DRY (Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) in regards to our Fruit class and the classes that inherited from it. We wanted to have different fruits (Apples, Oranges, Pears) be initialized with different diameters. For awhile we couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to do that without repeating the code containing the diameter instance variable, until&hellip;</p>

<p>Solution: passing an argument into <strong>super</strong> so the Superclass receives it.  I didn&rsquo;t know super was capable of that. Ruby, you are so nifty and great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First off, let me say, this was a priceless experience. If you have the choice to do some challenges or go to a DBC Hackathon as a boot&hellip; GO TO THE HACKATHON! You will be able to participate and contribute and you&rsquo;ll be exposed to so many things. I just finished Phase 1 &ndash; Week 2, and I was still able to make a substantial amount of meaningful input. I loved it.</p>

<p><strong>8:45am &ndash; Arrive</strong></p>

<p>After app pitches, we pick which one interests us and converge.  Our team? 5 people: 2 DBC alums and 3 (that includes myself) Phase 1 students.</p>

<h4>Our goal?</h4>

<p>I should preface this by saying the Phase 1 students have no JavaScript experience, vanilla or otherwise.</p>

<p>Use JS to build a 9 x 9 board of cells. Randomly generate  (horizontal/vertical)unions between the cells.</p>

<p>Make a Dynamic Connectivity algorithm to see if there is a path that will connect two points, A and B on the board.  We were kind of stuck on the algorithm until a fellow Banana Slug, Quentin (my brother from another mother), came by and gave a great explanation on it.</p>

<p>Animate the algorithm, so we can see it make a path as it goes through various possiblities until it finally reaches the destination cell OR runs out of possible options.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.minus.com/ihuIdgNySiXPd.JPG" alt="Recursion" /></p>

<h4>Execution</h4>

<p>Javascript &ndash; closures!! You can wrap a group of functions together such that the variables in the &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; can be used by functions contained in the wrapper but not by those outside of it. In other words &hellip; Whenever you see the function keyword within another function, the inner function has access to variables in the outer function. It&rsquo;s all about the scope!!</p>

<p>Two things went wrong:</p>

<p>1) Animation debacle! Unfortunately tried as we might, we couldn&rsquo;t get it working in time by the end of the Hackathon. The animation was the fresh coat of paint on the whole project.  At least we do know through thorough testing that our algorithm works as it should.</p>

<p>2) Because the unions are randomly generated, there isn&rsquo;t always a path from A to B.</p>

<h4><strong>10:00pm &ndash; &ldquo;Pencils down&rdquo;</strong></h4>

<p>Our team takes a huddle to discuss how we&rsquo;re going to present, points to concentrate on, things we took away, etc.</p>

<h4><strong>10:20pm &ndash; Judging</strong></h4>

<p>There were some amazing apps, only two teams had Phase 1 boots, and one of them won!  It wasn&rsquo;t us, but I was still really proud of everyone in my cohort that participated!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>7:30am &ndash; Arrive</strong></p>

<p>TEAM PROJECTS!  Holy crap &ndash; nervous and excited (but this seems to be the norm for my DBC experience thus far). NO RULES! NO RULES?!</p>

<p>Well, maybe one &ndash; push ourselves but don&rsquo;t bite off more than we can chew for our first project.</p>

<p>Our main goal &ndash; LEARN</p>

<p><img src="https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/555fcf42315d33424e6ed0c9f0a9568f6b4fbbfb/687474703a2f2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f32473170305530473133327231463335323034352f53637265656e25323053686f74253230323031332d31302d31382532306174253230332e33382e3237253230504d2e706e67" alt="Agile" /></p>

<h3>The 4 main goals of Agile:</h3>

<ul>
<li>individuals and interactions &mdash; are more worthy of our attention than &mdash; processes and tools</li>
<li>working software &mdash; is more worthy of our attention than &mdash; comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>customer collaboration &mdash; is more worthy of our attention than &mdash; contract negotiation</li>
<li>responding to change &mdash; is more worthy of our attention than &mdash; following a plan</li>
</ul>


<p>you want some clarification on that do you?</p>

<ul>
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer&rsquo;s competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Client-side personnel and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method ofconveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
<li>Simplicity&mdash;the art of maximizing the amount of work not done&mdash;is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Working Agreements</h3>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided to work with other human beings, things tend to get a little complicated.</p>

<p>The idea is that, once you&rsquo;re part of a team, it&rsquo;s impossible to operate independently without considering other members of your tribe. You have to spend time (basically overhead) to work out how to interact with each other in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a project has just started on Friday and your team is supposed to work through the weekend. does everyone agree on that plan? What if someone on the team had other plans for the weekend? When will everyone else find out? Not on Saturday morning, I hope.</p>

<ul>
<li>who is part of the team (by naming individuals)?</li>
<li>what roles do they play (although generic roles are ok, specific roles are better)?</li>
<li>how do people stay in touch (cell phones, email, etc)?</li>
<li>when will the team work together vs apart?</li>
<li>what are the working hours?</li>
<li>what absences are expected?</li>
<li>what are your goals as a team?</li>
<li>what are your shared values as a team?</li>
</ul>


<p>Dinner was pizza with some of the cohort and then back to DBC for some coding!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>7:15am &ndash; Arrive</p>

<p>After going through how to design the schema for the different database types [One to One; One to Many; Many to Many] our challenge was to get aquainted with PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>My thoughts &ndash; it&rsquo;s one ugly but powerful duckling. After getting our feet wet we were supposed to use Ruby to create a database and then the faker gem to populate the tables with some fake data, but we wanted to get a little dirtier so we went into Terminal and loaded up psql &ndash; created a database, some tables and columns and populated the fields ourselves. It was good to know what to expect from Postgres when we entered things correctly and incorrectly.  After that we went ahead and did it the way we were supposed to using Ruby.</p>

<p>Tonight I took a small break in the evening to meet some good friends of mine who were visiting from overseas. A nice luxury to unwind for 90 minutes before heading back to DBC to spend some more time trying to hog-tie PostGres</p>

<p>00:30am &ndash; Depart</p>

<p>We had to build the program using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design method.</p>

<p>The general consensus is that in Ruby the lines are semi-fuzzy between the Model and the Controller.  Apparently this fuzziness clears up dramaticaly in Rails, but since we&rsquo;re not yet using Rails, my partner and I had a discussion and mini-whiteboard session to see if we preferred one way over the other.  Ultimately we decided to have our Model hold not only the data but also the methods for manipulating the data, where our Controller essentially acted as the interpreter for what the View was saying.</p>

<p>One of the early problems we encountered was how to have our program add to the external todo list (txt file) without overwriting what was already in it.  The solution was to use &lsquo;a+&rsquo; with File.open</p>
