7:15am - Arrive

After going through how to design the schema for the different database types [One to One; One to Many; Many to Many] our challenge was to get aquainted with PostgreSQL.

My thoughts - it's one ugly but powerful duckling. After getting our feet wet we were supposed to use Ruby to create a database and then the faker gem to populate the tables with some fake data, but we wanted to get a little dirtier so we went into Terminal and loaded up psql - created a database, some tables and columns and populated the fields ourselves. It was good to know what to expect from Postgres when we entered things correctly and incorrectly.  After that we went ahead and did it the way we were supposed to using Ruby.

Tonight I took a small break in the evening to meet some good friends of mine who were visiting from overseas. A nice luxury to unwind for 90 minutes before heading back to DBC to spend some more time trying to hog-tie PostGres
