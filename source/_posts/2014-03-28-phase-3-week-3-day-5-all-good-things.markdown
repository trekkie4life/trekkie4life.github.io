Everyone's projects turned out extremely well. I was happy for everyone in my cohort, and I couldn't be prouder of the GlucoseAmigo team. I know they'll all be great developers and co-workers. Any company would be lucky to have them.

Where to even begin - this has been a life changing experience for me.
  
I came in, eager to learn but worried, "Is this all hype? Can I really learn that much in short amount of time? What if I can't keep up? What if? What if?"

What did I encounter?

A diverse group of people, whose path and journey to this point were all unique, with the same fears as I had and the same goal... to want the skill to be able to create beautiful and meaningful things.  

Teachers and mentors genuinely interested in seeing all of us acheive our dream and make sure we had the tools to do so.

An environment open to different viewpoints and facilitating communication, where the only rule was "don't be an asshole" (my wording).

I probably grew more as a person in that time period, facing my own demons and shortcomings, than I have at any other time in my life... and gained some of my closest friends from it.

Well, the next step is now here - Finding the right place for my first job in a new career. A journey that could last a few weeks or a few months. I'm sure it will be just as tough as DBC if not more so. More ups and downs, but this time I know I'm not alone, I have my friends, family, and fellow Banana Slugs - and more importantly, I know I can do it.  
  
See you all on the other side.
