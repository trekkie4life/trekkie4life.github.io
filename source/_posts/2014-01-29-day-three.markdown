8:15am - arrive

Solo (optional) day

Didn’t go solo, had the pleasure of pairing with Quentin - my brother from another mother.

AM coding - Basic Data Structures

Hawaiian BBQ for lunch - highly recommend it for fellow protein loving boots.

Shadi gives us a nice tutorial on Test Driven Development (TDD). Quentin and I decided to approach the afternoon’s challenges utilizing this new and powerful tool by utilitizing asserts to test as opposed to “puts” statements.

We wrote a bunch of tests and then started putting it together, locating the error in the stack, debugging that particular error, saving and retesting.

PM coding - Abstract Data Structures (ADT)

Some coaches had a very nice indepth teaching session on Git. I entered feeling like I had a basic idea of what was going on, I walked out feeling very confident I have a solid high-level understanding of how to correctly use Git moving forward.

12:30am - left
