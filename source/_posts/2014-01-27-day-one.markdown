It's been over 12 weeks of official prep work - and something that I got accepted for in May of 2013.  Hard to believe it's finally here. Not having a programming background I am definitely nervous.  
  
	- Be open with your ignorance
	- Don't be afraid to ask questions
	- Teach if you understand something
	- Be kind
	- Critically ride the wave of curiosity
	- Sleep
	- Step away from the bubble


The first half of the morning was getting to know our fellow cohorts and the DBC family, the resources available to us, and what to expect.  
  
Lunch followed and then afterward we were coding in the afternoon. We paired 3 times in 3 hours. Taking what we learned/applied/how we approached to each subsequent pairing session. It was much more useful than I initially thought it would be. I gained a lot of insight from pairing several times on the SAME challenge.
  
A final note - I made the right decision to come and attend. No doubt about it :)
