**8:15am - Arrive**

Solo (optional) day

Didn’t go solo, had the pleasure of pairing with Quentin - my brother from another mother.  Happy to say he's a friend of mine thanks to our pairing sessions in Phase 0. He helped me grasp a lot of concepts that were foreign to me in the prep work. One hell of a guy.

AM coding - Basic Data Structures

Hawaiian BBQ for lunch - highly recommend it for fellow protein loving boots.

Shadi gives us a nice tutorial on Test Driven Development (TDD). Quentin and I decided to approach the afternoon’s challenges utilizing this new and powerful tool by utilitizing asserts to test as opposed to “puts” statements.

We wrote a bunch of tests and then started putting it together, locating the error in the stack, debugging that particular error, saving and retesting.

PM coding - Abstract Data Structures (ADT)

Some coaches had a very nice indepth teaching session on Git. I entered feeling like I had a basic idea of what was going on, I walked out feeling very confident I have a solid high-level understanding of how to correctly use Git moving forward.

Our goals each week at DBC are broken down into 3 stages of 'mastery' using the Japanese concept of 'Shuhari' (しゅはり), which roughly translates to: "first learn, then detach, and finally transcend"



**12:30am - Depart**
