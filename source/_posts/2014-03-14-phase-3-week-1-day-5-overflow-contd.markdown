**8:30am - Arrive**

Friday morning check-ins, one of my favorite parts of DBC. Steven, the instructor in our check-in circle made the observation of it being very cyclical - like seasons changing - it made a lot of people feel more at ease, especially the phase 1'ers.

We spent today adding integration tests via Capybara, and then cleaning up the code and combining our vertical slices together. There were a few hiccups, but nothing we couldn't handle. A lot of functionality is there and now we have Saturday and Sunday to put a little polish on it and add a couple more features (like search!).




**10:40pm - Depart**
