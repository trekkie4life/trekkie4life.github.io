8:06am - arrive

coding challenges - roman numerals - encoding and decoding them. After doing the first two parts, it was great fun to look at the case studies (collection of 29 examples of student code) and see where they differ and are similar. You start to be able to recognize how efficient/clean/easy to read different methods and approaches are. Then we use what we learned there to re-write our roman-numeral encoding method from scratch.

Engineering Empathy training session with Karim Bishay - eye opening for sure. This kind of training will apply well to all areas of my life. We did an exercise where we confront out superego. Some people were crying afterward, who can blame them though. Luckily DBC is a very safe space to expose vulnerabilities and insecurities  Very intense. It's no wonder they planned that right before our first yoga session.  The yoga for those that are wondering is very meditative and relaxing, you won't be sweating afterwards, more getting in tune with your body and re-centering your mind. I promised my girlfriend I'd be going at least 3 times a week for the duration of the course. It is mandatory Tues & Thur for Phase 1.

PM coding challenges - learning about different kinds of sorting and their Big O notation.

####Bubblesort
is not very impressive and takes a LOOOONG time

####Quicksort
you select a random piece of data, that's your pivot point. You remove that from the array you want to sort, now you separate the remaining data into 2 groups (let's call them): Left, Right. A piece of data goes into left if it's value is less than the pivot point. If it's greater than the pivot point, it goes into Right. You then run quicksort again on the two new sets of data Left, and Right.  Wait - is that recursion? NICE!
