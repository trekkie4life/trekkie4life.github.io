**11:00am - Arrive**

The CSS challenge: Editing only the CSS file, can we make a webpage identical to a given screenshot.

The answer: Yes, we can. 

Moral of the story: CSS can be your best friend but one who likes to punch you in the face when you least expect it.

`float` can mess some things up, use it sparingly.

Use Chrome Developer Tools, they are your best friend.

Ahhh, the beauty of CSS.
