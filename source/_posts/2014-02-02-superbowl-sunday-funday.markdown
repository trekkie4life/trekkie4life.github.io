I've heard many times from many different people that the main thing to do after a vigorous week is to relax for a little bit and let the mind recoup from the vigors of the week. So today was errand day, stocked up on some groceries then headed into DBC.

**11:30am - Arrival**

Review, Review, Review and Reading! 

**3:30pm - Depart**

After that - it was pizza, beer, and Superbowl time.

Hard to believe week 2 starts tomorrow. One week down, eight to go!
