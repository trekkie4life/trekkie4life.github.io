11:30am arrival

I've heard many times from many different people that the main thing to do after a vigorous week is to relax for a little bit and let the mind recoup from the vigors of the week. So today was errand day, stocked up on some groceries then headed into DBC to review stuff from Week 1 and to do some reading.

After that - it was pizza, beer, and Superbowl time.

Hard to believe week 2 starts tomorrow. One week down, eight to go!
