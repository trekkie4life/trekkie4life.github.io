**7:30am - Arrive**

TEAM PROJECTS!  Holy crap - nervous and excited (but this seems to be the norm for my DBC experience thus far). NO RULES! NO RULES?!

Well, maybe one - push ourselves but don't bite off more than we can chew for our first project.

Our main goal - LEARN

###The 4 main goals of Agile:

* individuals and interactions -- are more worthy of our attention than -- processes and tools
* working software -- is more worthy of our attention than -- comprehensive documentation
* customer collaboration -- is more worthy of our attention than -- contract negotiation
* responding to change -- is more worthy of our attention than -- following a plan


you want some clarification on that do you?  

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Client-side personnel and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method ofconveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


###Working Agreements
Once you've decided to work with other human beings, things tend to get a little complicated.

The idea is that, once you're part of a team, it's impossible to operate independently without considering other members of your tribe. You have to spend time (basically overhead) to work out how to interact with each other in a meaningful way.

For example, imagine a project has just started on Friday and your team is supposed to work through the weekend. does everyone agree on that plan? What if someone on the team had other plans for the weekend? When will everyone else find out? Not on Saturday morning, I hope.

* who is part of the team (by naming individuals)?
* what roles do they play (although generic roles are ok, specific roles are better)?
* how do people stay in touch (cell phones, email, etc)?
* when will the team work together vs apart?
* what are the working hours?
* what absences are expected?
* what are your goals as a team?
* what are your shared values as a team?

Dinner was pizza with some of the cohort and then back to DBC for some coding!
