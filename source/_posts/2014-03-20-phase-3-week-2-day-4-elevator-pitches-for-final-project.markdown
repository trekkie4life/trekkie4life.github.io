**8:30am - Arrive**

Elevator pitch time! Everyone had some really killer ideas, I wonder which ideas will be picked. Matthew's presentation was hilarious, he totally nailed it.

My idea? Near and dear to my heart. Well, here's the beginning of the pitch:

"We're here at DBC learning to create beautiful and meaningful things, but there are a few industries that aren't really utilizing this amazing technology that we have. One that stands out to me is the medical industry. The way we went to the doctor today is the same way it was 40 years ago..."

And I segwayed into diabetes and wanting to create an app that diabetics could use to track their blood sugar and weight and that would automatically email/fax their doctor their readings for the week. Some bonus features: a graph to see how they were doing historically which showed where their glucose readings fell in relation to a normal range; a way to search for foods and have their glycemic index returned.

You want to hear the whole thing? Aw, well you'll just have to come to DBC to see people give theirs!

Well, after that it was off to vote on the top ideas. Out of the 16 pitches, 4 would be picked to be made into projects. If your idea is picked, then as the person who pitched it, you are product manager (unless you don't want to be).

The final 4:  
* Book Meetup (Matthew Knudson)  
* Feed Me (Johnny Wu)  
* Better Bets (Irene)
* Glucose Amigo (Myself)

Now it's time for everyone (excluding the project managers) to list 3 teams in order of preference. I'm really curious who will end up wanting to work on my project and work with me.

The outcome - A killer team, Chris "The Congressman" Woodrich, Quentin "Michael Jordan" Devauchelle, Tim "The Analogy" Yi, and Chermaine "The Machine" Zimmerman.

working agreement, expectations, user stories, what makes up an MVP and what are the stretch goals

We decided to go with a mobile first webapp. And got to coding - this next week is going to be intense. REALLY intense.

Head down, seatbelts fastened... I anticipate some crazy hours ahead, so I'm not sure I'll be able to continue writing on a daily basis.



**12:30am - Depart**
