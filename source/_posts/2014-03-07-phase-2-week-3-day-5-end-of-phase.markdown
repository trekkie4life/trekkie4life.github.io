**8:00am - Arrive**

A quick review of JavaScript prototypal inheritance. In most languages (like Ruby), classes inherit from other classes. In JS, the inheritance is "prototype" based, that means there are NO CLASSES. Instead an object inherits from another object. 


Inheritance, the __proto__ - When an object rabbit inherits from another object animal, in JavaScript that means that there is a special property rabbit.__proto__ = animal.

When a rabbit property is accessed, and the interpreter canâ€™t find it in rabbit, it follows the __proto__ link and searches in animal.

One could put a method into animal and it becomes available in rabbit.

The phase 3'ers had their final project presentations today - They were great, and I'm a bit overwhelmed. I can see it happening, but I can't imagine it happening in 3 weeks. It's kind of mind boggling... even after being in this program for 6 weeks already.



**8:00pm - Depart**
