**8:00am - Arrive**

###Morning session:

* Part 1: public vs private interfaces: the interface is the contract
* Part 2: argument order dependency: fewer dependencies is always better
* Part 3: the self keyword: to thine own self be true
* Part 4: classical inheritance: hierarchies are good
* Part 5: object composition: but composites are better, or so some say
* Part 6: oo terminology: review the words that change your thoughts

**12:30pm - Lunch break & Yoga**

Afternoon session:
We are introduced to basic application development using the object oriented programming paradigm. Because this is my first time using this approach, it's taking my mind some time to switch from thinking about how to solve the problem procedurally. OO definitely makes more sense for a ton of things so having the exposure now will only help me in the long run.

###an object has both state and behavior

We dive into building/modeling an interface for a hospital. Users interact with the system via the terminal. Different levels of access for different employees (one example: doctors can add to patient records, but receptionists can not).


Authenticate via user passwords which are stored in the program in a private method whose values are returned to a public method that calls it.

**10:30pm - Depart** - feels good to head home at a "decent" time!
