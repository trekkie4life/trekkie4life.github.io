Git workflow - how to deal with Merge Conflicts

Once you are committed locally  

* `$ git co master`
* `$ git pull`
* `$ git co (my_branch)`
* `$ git rebase master`
* `$ git push origin (my_branch)`

And that's how you make sure you're up todate and won't have merge conflicts!




**10:35pm - Depart**
