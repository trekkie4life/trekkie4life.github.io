**8:25am - Arrive**

Today's mission: build a one-page app using (at least) jQuery, Javascript, and AJAX to render questions to the user, allow them to submit answers, tell them whether or not their submitted answer was correct, and give them their final correct/incorrect tally.

We were only allowed to modify the front end - we couldn't touch ANYTHING on the backend.

Challenging - hell yeah, it's the first time since we used API's at the end of phase 2 that we didn't have control over the backend as well.

Having that restriction put on us was difficult, but a better model of what awaits us in the real world as junior developers.  A junior dev won't exactly be handed the keys to the database and backend.

Tomorrow we pitch project ideas, I'm not sure what I will pitch but I should pitch something for the mere practice of it.


**11:55pm - Depart**
