**8:30am - Arrive**

Well, after that late night last night, I need to sleep. I could've used another hour but I'm excited for group projects.

picked our groups, I'm pumped with ours, lots of potential and people with great strengths.


Our team name? THE ULTIMATE AMAZING SUPER BEST FRIENDS!

We design the database schema and then delegate tasks - we form an attack plan and keep communication open with stand-ups every couple hours. We use good git practices and use git pull/rebase before pushing a branch up, then we review eachother's code on pull requests.

A note on git rebasing... when you rebase and sort out a merge conflict, be sure you `git rebase --continue` to finish the actual rebasing process!!

We had a really really good flow going and while underpressure to deliver an MVP at 5pm, we had a good time. Hard to beat that kind of group dynamic.
