**8:00am - Arrive**

Officially make it into Phase 3, which is nice. Part of me feels not ready. Part of me is... I feel like I need more time to gain a very very solid understanding on some things, but as I learn more I realize that I know less. It's humbling and makes you want to strive for more... but at the same time, when is enough actually enough? When will you ever feel comfortable?

Today, we aimed for maximum test coverage. Test Coverage shows which parts of your code are tested and which are not. It does not say anything about the quality of those tests, so make sure you are also writing meaningful tests.

**11:00pm - Depart**
